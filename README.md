🚀 Data-Driven Insights for Men’s T20 Cricket 🏏

I’m currently working on a fascinating case study analyzing key metrics from Men’s T20 International matches, which involves using a dataset with detailed columns like Team1, Team2, Winner, Match Date, Ground, and average rankings for batting and bowling. By diving deep into this data, I’m creating an interactive dashboard that provides powerful insights for fans, analysts, and sports enthusiasts alike.

Here’s a sneak peek of what the analysis reveals:

Total Number of Countries: By analyzing the dataset, we track how many different countries have participated in T20 matches as Team 1 or Team 2, giving a broader view of global cricket representation.
Batting Rankings: A breakdown of the average batting rankings for both Team 1 and Team 2 gives us insight into which teams dominate in the batting order. We can track how these rankings correlate with match outcomes.
Bowling Rankings: Similarly, analyzing Team 1 and Team 2’s average bowling rankings uncovers trends in bowling performance, highlighting teams with the most effective bowling line-ups.
Ground and Match Data: By mapping the grounds where the T20 International matches took place, alongside the number of matches hosted, we can see which venues are key hosts for high-stakes games.
